# ScaraSimulation
<p align="right"></p>

This project is a robot simulation designed to showcase the 
capabilities of a virtual robot within a simulated environment. 
The simulation provides a platform for testing and developing robotic 
algorithms, control strategies, and navigation systems.

## Features

* Robot Model: The simulation includes a customizable robot model, allowing users to define the robot's physical properties such as dimensions, joints, and sensors.

* Environment (Comming soon): A dynamic and interactive environment is provided for the robot to operate in. Users can create and modify the environment, including obstacles, landmarks, and other objects.

* Robot Control: Users can implement and test different control algorithms to manipulate the robot's motion and behavior.

* Visualization: The simulation provides real-time visualization of the robot's movements, sensor data, and environmental changes. Users can observe and analyze the robot's behavior during runtime.

## Usage
Pick-and-Place Tasks: Simulate a SCARA robot performing pick-and-place tasks in an industrial setting. Develop and optimize algorithms for object detection, grasp planning, and trajectory generation. Test the robot's ability to accurately and efficiently pick up objects from one location and place them in another.

Assembly Line Automation: Create a simulation of a robot working on an assembly line. Develop control strategies for precise positioning and manipulation of parts. Test the robot's ability to assemble components, perform tasks such as screwing or welding, and optimize the assembly process.

Calibration and Kinematics Analysis: Use the simulation to calibrate the robot's kinematic parameters, such as link lengths and joint offsets. Develop algorithms for inverse kinematics and forward kinematics to accurately control the robot's position and orientation. Verify the accuracy of the kinematic models through simulation and analysis.

Offline Programming: Develop an offline programming system for the  robot using the simulation. Enable users to define and simulate robot tasks without physically interacting with the robot. Test the generated robot programs in the simulation environment to ensure their correctness and efficiency.
